    While Stephan is <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/express-delivery/share/de89191e897234cfb3468291385963d9/">running
    with cargo</a>,
    Nicola and Sophia invnted the game with boxes.

</p>

<p>
    At the beginning of the game several black and white balls are placed in the box.
    Then the robots for each move take the ball out of the box and put the ball back of the opposite color.
    The winner is the one who pulls the white ball on the <strong>Nth</strong> step.
</p>

<p>
    The robots don't like indeterminacy and want to know the probability of a white ball on Nth step.
    The probability is a value between 0 (0% chance or will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or will happen).
    The result is a float from 0 to 1 with two digits precision.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a start set of balls as a string that contains "b" (black) and "w" (white) and the number of the step
    (N).
    The order of the balls does not matter.
