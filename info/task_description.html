    While Stephan is <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/express-delivery/share/de89191e897234cfb3468291385963d9/">running
     cargo</a>, Nicola and Sophia invented a game with boxes.

</p>

<p>
    To start the game, they put several black and white pearls in one of the boxes.
    For each move, the robots take a pearl out of the box and put one of the opposite color back.
    The winner is the one who pulls the white pearl on the <strong>Nth</strong> step.
</p>

<p>
    Our robots don't like indeterminacy and want to know the probability of a white pearl on the Nth step.
    The probability is a value between 0 (0% chance or will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or will happen).
    The result is a float from 0 to 1 with two digits precision.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a start set of pearles as a string that contains "b" (black) and "w" (white) and the number of the step
    (N).
    The order of the pearles does not matter.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The start sequence of the pearles (string) and the step's number (int).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The probability for white pearl, a float.
